"""Forest of trees-based ensemble methods.

Those methods include random forests.

The module structure is the following:

- The ``BaseForest`` base class implements a common ``fit`` method for all
  the estimators in the module. The ``fit`` method of the base ``Forest``
  class calls the ``fit`` method of each sub-estimator on random samples
  (with replacement, a.k.a. bootstrap) of the training set.

  The init of the sub-estimator is further delegated to the
  ``BaseEnsemble`` constructor.

- The ``ForestLabelRanker`` and ``ForestPartialLabelRanker`` base classes
  further implement the prediction logic by aggregating the predicted
  outcomes of the sub-estimators.

- The ``RandomForestLabelRanker`` and ``RandomForestPartialLabelRanker``
  derived classes provide the user with concrete implementations of
  the forest ensemble method using classical, deterministic
  ``DecisionTreeLabelRanker`` and ``DecisionTreePartialLabelRanker`` as
  sub-estimator implementations.

Label Ranking and Partial Label Ranking problems are both handled.

    """A random forest Label Ranker.

    A random forest is a meta estimator that fits a number of decision tree
    Label Rankers on various sub-samples of the dataset and uses aggregating to
    improve the predictive power and control over-fitting.
    The sub-sample size is always the same as the original
    input sample size but the samples are drawn with replacement if
    `bootstrap=True` (default).

    Hyperparameters
    ---------------
    n_estimators : int, optional (default=100)
        The number of trees in the forest.

    criterion : str, optional (default="mallows")
        The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria are
        "mallows" for the Mallows impurity.

    distance : str, optional (default="kendall")
        The distance function to measure the proximity between rankings.
        Supported distances are "kendall" for the Kendall distance.
        This is only employed if ``criterion="mallows"``.

    splitter : str, optional (default="binary")
        The strategy used to choose the split at each node. Supported
        strategies are "binary" to choose the best binary split, "width"
        to choose the best equal-width split and "frequency" to choose
        the best equal-frequency split.

    max_depth : {int, None}, optional (default=None)
        The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until
        all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than
        min_samples_split samples.

    min_samples_split : {int, float}, optional (default=2)
        The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:

            - If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
            - If float, then `min_samples_split` is a fraction and
              `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum
              number of samples for each split.

    max_features : {int, float, str, None}, optional (default=None)
        The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:

            - If int, then consider `max_features` features at each split.
            - If float, then `max_features` is a fraction and
              `int(max_features * n_features)` features are considered at each
              split.
            - If "auto", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
            - If "sqrt", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
            - If "log2", then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.
            - If `None`, then `max_features=n_features`.

        Note: The search for a split does not stop until at least one
        valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to
        effectively inspect more than ``max_features`` features.

    max_splits : int, optional (default=2)
        The maximum number of splits.

    random_state : {int, RandomState instance, None}, optional (default=None)
        - If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator.
        - If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator.
        - If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
          by `np.random`.

     max_samples: {int, float}, optional (default=None)
        If bootstrap is True, the number of samples to draw from X
        to train each base estimator.

        - If None (default), then draw `X.shape[0]` samples.
        - If int, then draw `max_samples` samples.
        - If float, then draw `max_samples * X.shape[0]` samples. Thus,
          `max_samples` should be in the interval `(0, 1)`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    base_estimator_ : DecisionTreeLabelRanker
        The child estimator template used to create the collection of fitted
        sub-estimators.

    estimators_ : list of DecisionTreeLabelRanker
        The collection of fitted sub-estimators.

    n_samples_ : int
        The number of samples when ``fit`` is performed.

    n_features_ : int
        The number of features when ``fit`` is performed.

    n_classes_ : int
        The number of classes when ``fit`` is performed.

    Notes
    -----
    The default values for the hyperparameters controlling the size of the
    trees (e.g. ``max_depth``, ``min_samples_leaf``, etc.) lead to fully grown
    and unpruned trees which can potentially be very large on some data sets.
    To reduce memory consumption, the complexity and size of the trees should
    be controlled by setting those hyperparameter values.

    The features are always randomly permuted at each split. Therefore,
    the best found split may vary, even with the same training data and
    ``max_features=n_features``, if the improvement of the criterion is
    identical for several splits enumerated during the search of the best
    split. To obtain a deterministic behaviour during fitting,
    ``random_state`` has to be fixed.
